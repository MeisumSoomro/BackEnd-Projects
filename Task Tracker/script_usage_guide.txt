OPTIONAL SETUP FOR EASIER ACCESS
------------------------------
Windows:
1. Add script directory to PATH:
   - Open System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables
   - Edit Path variable
   - Add full path to directory containing tasks.bat
   - Restart CMD

Linux/Mac:
1. Create symlink:
   sudo ln -s /full/path/to/tasks.sh /usr/local/bin/tasks
   
2. Or add to PATH in ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
   export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/task/tracker"

After setup, you can use 'tasks' command from any directory:
tasks add "New Task" "Description" P1
tasks list

TIPS
----
1. Use quotes around titles and descriptions
2. For descriptions with special characters:
   - Windows: Use double quotes
   - Linux/Mac: Use single or double quotes

3. Priority levels:
   P1 - High priority
   P2 - Medium priority
   P3 - Low priority (default)

4. Task statuses:
   TODO - Not started
   IN_PROGRESS - Currently working
   DONE - Completed

5. Regular maintenance:
   - Review tasks daily
   - Update priorities as needed
   - Clean up completed tasks
